    # This is the path for the API
    # This code specifies the URL path for the API. 
    # This was the final step that completes the building of the API.
    # You can now perform CRUD operations on the Shawarma model. 
    # The router class allows you to make the following queries:
    #
    #
    # /shawarmas/ - returns a list of all the Shawarmas items. 
    # CREATE and READ operations can be performed here.
    # /shawarmas/id - returns a single Todo item using the id primary key. 
    # UPDATE and DELETE operations can be performed here.
    # 
    # Letâ€™s restart the server:
    #   " python manage.py runserver "
    # 
    # Navigate to http://localhost:8000/api/shawarmas in your web browser:
    path('api/', include(router.urls)),
